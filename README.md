### Data
Data is available in YAML or JSON, and recipes use the following format specification. 

#### `title`
Title of the recipe.

#### `description`
Information about the recipe that would not be considered instructions.

#### `ingredients`
Lists ingredients for the recipe. May be an array, or a hash listing different ingredient groups.

	ingredients:
		required: 
			- ketchup

		optional: 
			- mustard

		additions: 
			- relish

#### `instructions`
Instructions on how to make the recipe.

#### `category`
Allows you to specify a category for the recipe.

#### `page`
If the source of the recipe is a book, this allows you to specify the page. 

#### `estimate`
An estimate for the cost to make the recipe. Does not include `$`, has two decimal places, and the three letter currency abbreviation. 

	estimate: 2.50 USD

#### `serves`
The number of people you can expect to serve with this recipe. This may be a range by using a dash.

	serves: 2-4

#### `makes`
The number of items that this recipe makes. This may be a range by using a dash. May include a unit (such as `cups`), but if it makes a number of items, the item should not be used as a unit (for a taco recipe, it makes `4-8` instead of `4-8 tacos`)

	makes: 4-8 cups

#### `ways` (optional)
Allows variations to the ingredients, instructions, or any other property to be listed. 

	ways:
		with pepper:
			estimate: 1.00
		
			ingredients:
				required:
					- pepper

			instructions: At the end, add the pepper.

For fields that contain lists (such as `ingredients` and `instructions`), the base list will be added to. Fields that contain values (such as `estimate` or `page`) replace the base value.

## Contribute
All data entry takes place in the `/recipes/source` folder as `YAML`. The rest of the formats are generated using `rake` (please use 10.4+), so in order to change them, you need to edit the data in the source `YAML`, then run `rake` to regenerate. 

I've included a Javascript reference client to help in checking the data, and developing the format. You can view it using `rake serve`.
