name: Vegetable Jambalaya
page: 97
category: dinner
serves: 6
estimate: 3.90 USD
description: 'I don’t make jambalaya exactly the way they do down south, but this vegetable-heavy version is faster and just as good—a great, throw-everything-inthe-pot kind of meal. It’s spicy, savory and deeply satisfying. The leftovers are great for making burritos or warmed up with a fried egg on top.

'
ingredients:
  required:
  - 2 tbsp vegetable oil
  - 1 medium onion, chopped
  - 1 green bell pepper, chopped
  - 3 stalks celery, chopped
  - 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
  - 1/2 small green chili, finely chopped
  - 2 large tomatoes, chopped
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 1 tsp paprika
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp cayenne pepper
  - 1/2 tsp dried thyme
  - 1/2 tsp dried oregano
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1 tsp pepper
  - 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce or soy sauce
  - 3/4 cup long grain rice
  - 3 cups vegetable broth or chicken stock
  additions:
  - slices of fried sausage
  - shrimp
  - leftover meat, tofu, or beans
instructions: |-
  Start with the oil in a large high-sided saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, pepper, and celery, then cook for about 5 minutes, until they become translucent but not brown.

  Add the rest of the ingredients except for the rice and broth. Let everything cook for about 1 minute to let some of the tomato juice release.

  Add the rice and slowly pour in the broth. Reduce the heat to medium and let the dish cook until the rice absorbs all the liquid. It should take about 20 to 25 minutes.

  If you’re using any of the additions, throw them in at about the 15-minute mark to let them warm up.
