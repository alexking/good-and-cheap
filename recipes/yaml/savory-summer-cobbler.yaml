description: 'Celebrate summer’s most ubiquitous vegetables, tomato and zucchini,
  with a crunchy Southern biscuit topping.

'
ingredients:
  required:
  - 3-4 medium zucchini or summer squash, chopped into bite-sized pieces
  - 3-4 large tomatoes, canned or fresh, chopped into bite-sized pieces
  - 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
  - 4 scallions, finely chopped
  - 1 lemon, zested
  - 1/4 cup fresh basil (optional)
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - salt
  - pepper
  topping:
  - 1 1/2 cups all-purpose or whole-wheat flour
  - 1/2 cup cornmeal
  - 1 tbsp baking powder
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1 tsp black pepper
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1/2 cup sharp cheddar, grated
  - 1/2 cup butter
  - 1 cup milk
instructions: |-
  Put the butter for the topping in the freezer for 30 minutes. Set the oven to 425 °F.

  Lightly oil an 8” x 10” baking dish (or any baking dish that will accommodate the mixture) and pile in the vegetables, garlic, scallions, lemon zest, and basil. Pour the olive oil, salt, and pepper over top and mix it up with your hands. Bake the vegetables for 25 minutes while you prepare the biscuit topping.

  For the topping, measure out the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, pepper, paprika, and cheese into a bowl. Mix it up!

  Once the butter is frozen, use a box grater to flake the butter into the flour mixture. Gently massage the butter into the flour with your fingers until it’s crumbly but still clumpy. Add the milk and quickly bring the dough together. Don’t knead the dough: lumpiness is fine and results in flaky topping. Put it in the fridge until the vegetables come out of the oven.

  Once the vegetable mixture has cooked for 25 minutes, quickly top it with small clumps of biscuit dough. The vegetables should still be visible in some areas.

  Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until the vegetables are bubbly and the topping is lightly browned. Top with some more cheddar and some chopped herbs, then enjoy!

  For a variation, swap the zucchini for eggplant. Chop the eggplant into bite-sized pieces, salt them, and set them aside for 30 minutes before continuing with the recipe as you would with the zucchini.
