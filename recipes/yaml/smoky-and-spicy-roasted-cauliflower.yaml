description: 'Roasted veggies are always delicious, but there’s something magical
  that happens to cauliflower in the oven. It gets so crispy and nutty, and that flavor
  is brought out even more with the spices here. I’m happy to just eat a bowl of this
  for dinner, maybe with an egg on top.

'
ingredients:
  required:
  - 1 head cauliflower, cut into small pieces
  - 2 cloves garlic, unpeeled
  - 1 tbsp butter, melted
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
  - salt
  - pepper
instructions: |-
  Turn the oven to 400 °F.

  In a medium-sized roasting pan, arrange the cauliflower pieces and the unpeeled cloves of garlic. Pour the butter over the cauliflower and then sprinkle the spices over top. Use your hands to thoroughly coat the cauliflower with butter and spices.

  Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on how crispy you like the florets. Squeeze the roasted garlic throughout and trash the skins.
