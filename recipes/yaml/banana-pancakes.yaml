  With the creamy texture and delicious flavor of bananas, these pancakes are stunningly good. You will be seriously popular if you feed these to your family or friends. Another plus: this is a great way to get rid of mushy bananas (that doesn’t involve making banana bread).
ingredients:
  required:
  - 2 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1/4 cup brown sugar
  - 2 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp baking soda
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 2 bananas, mashed
  - 2 eggs
  - 1 1/2 cups milk
  - 1 tsp vanilla
  - 2 bananas, sliced
  - butter for cooking
instructions: |-
  In a medium bowl, add the flour, brown sugar, baking powder, soda and salt. Mix thoroughly with a spoon.

  In another bowl, add the mashed bananas (or just mash them in the bowl), eggs, milk, and vanilla, then mix. Add the dry mixture from the other bowl into the second bowl. Gently stir it with a spoon until everything just comes together. Tender pancakes come from not over-mixing the batter. If there are still a few pockets of flour, don’t worry about it. Let the mixture sit for 10 to 15 minutes.

  Place a non-stick or cast-iron pan on medium heat. Once it’s hot, melt a small amount of butter, about 1/2 teaspoon, then ladle some pancake batter into the center of the pan. You can make your pancakes as large or small as you like. A normal amount is about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of batter. If it’s your first time making pancakes, make them smaller: they’ll be easier to flip.

  As soon as the batter is in the pan, place 3 to 4 banana slices atop of the uncooked side of the pancake. Once the edges of the pancake start to dry up and you can see the middle start to bubble, flip the pancake over. Cook until it is browned on both sides. Stack the finished pancake on a plate in a warm oven and repeat the above process until you run out of batter.

  Serve hot, with butter and syrup.
