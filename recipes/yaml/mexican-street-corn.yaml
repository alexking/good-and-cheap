  This recipe takes fresh, sweet summer corn — already amazing — and adds salt, tang, and spice to the experience. If you have an outdoor grill, prepare the corn that way, but for those without, a broiler is a great  shortcut!
ingredients:
  required:
  - 4 cobs corn
  - 4 tbsp mayonnaise
  - 1/2 cup cotija, queso blanco, feta, Romano or Parmesan, grated chili powder
  - 1 lime, sliced into wedges
instructions: |-
  Turn your oven’s broiler up to high.

  Peel off the outer layers of the corn and clean off all the corn silk. Leave the green ends attached for a convenient handhold.

  Place the cobs on a baking pan under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, then rotate them and repeat until they’re brown and toasty all the way around. The broiling shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes total.

  Working quickly, spread a tablespoon of mayonnaise over each cob, lightly coating every kernel. Next, sprinkle the cheese all over the corn. It should stick fairly easily to the mayonnaise, but you’ll probably get a little messy coating them thoroughly.

  Sprinkle chili powder over the corn, but not too heavy or it’ll be gritty. Use any chili powder you like; ancho or cayenne are great.

  Lastly, squeeze lime juice all over and serve hot!
