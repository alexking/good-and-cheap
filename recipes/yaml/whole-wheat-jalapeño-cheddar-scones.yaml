  These are delicious for breakfast or with a plate of beans, a pile of vegetables, or alongside a chili or stew. Spicy, cheesy, flaky—these are best eaten straight out of the oven.
ingredients:
  required:
  - 1/2 cup butter
  - 2 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour
  - 1 tbsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 4 oz sharp cheddar, diced
  - 1 jalapeño, finely diced
  - 2 eggs, lightly beaten
  - 1/2 cup milk
  egg wash:
  - 1 egg
  - salt
  - pepper
instructions: |-
  Place the butter in the freezer for 30 minutes.

  Turn the oven to 400 °F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or lightly grease the pan if you don’t have the paper.

  In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.

  Prepare your jalapeño and cheese. Cutting the cheese into cubes rather than grating it means you’ll have pockets of gooey cheese that contrast nicely with the scone. If you want the spice of the jalapeño, leave the seeds and membrane; if you like it milder, remove them and chop up only the pepper itself.

  Remove the butter from the freezer and grate it directly into the flour mixture. (Use a cheese grater—it’s the best way to break up butter without melting it.) Using your hands, gently squish the butter into the flour until everything is incorporated but not smooth. The chunks of butter will create flaky scones. Add the jalapeño, cheese, eggs, and milk to the bowl, then use your hands to gently mix everything until it just comes together. It will probably be a little shaggy, but that’s just fine.

  Sprinkle flour on a clean countertop and dump the dough onto it. Gently shape the dough into a disc about 1 1/2” thick. Cut the dough into six triangles, like a pizza, and move them to the cookie sheet.

  In a small bowl, gently beat the egg for the egg wash. Brush it over the scones, then sprinkle salt and pepper over each one. Bake for 25 minutes or until the scones are golden brown.
