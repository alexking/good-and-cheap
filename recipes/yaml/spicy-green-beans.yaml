  Whenever I make these, I think, “why don’t I have this every day?” Throw a fried egg on top, serve with rice, and you have a delicious meal.
ingredients:
  required:
  - 1 tsp vegetable oil
  - 1/2 lb green beans, ends trimmed, chopped into bite-size pieces
  - 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
  - 1 tsp soy sauce
  - 1 tsp sambal oelek (or 2 tsp chili flakes)
  additions:
  - 1 tsp ginger, grated
  - 1 tsp lemon juice
instructions: |-
  Add the vegetable oil to a frying pan on medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the green beans. Let them cook undisturbed for about 1 minute.

  Mix the garlic, soy sauce, and sambal oelek in a bowl (and the ginger and lemon juice, if using).

  The beans should have turned bright green. Add about 1/4 cup of water to the pan. Cook another 2 minutes, until the water is mostly gone. Pour the sauce into the pan and toss gently to coat. Cook another 2 minutes, until everything is fragrant and most of the liquid is gone. Poke the beans with a fork: if it goes through easily, they’re done. They should take about 5 minutes.

  Taste and add more chili sauce or soy sauce if you want the beans hotter or saltier.
