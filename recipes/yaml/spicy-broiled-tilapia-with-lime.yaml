name: Spicy Broiled Tilapia with Lime
page: 126
category: dinner
serves: 2
estimate: 9.00 USD
description: 'This meal comes together so quickly it’s astonishing. Broiled fish is
  crispy on the outside and flaky and moist on the inside. If you quickly sauté some
  vegetables while the fish cooks, dinner will be on the table in minutes.

'
ingredients:
  required:
  - 2 fillets tilapia or other white fish
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp pepper
  - 1 tsp cayenne pepper
  - 1 tsp cumin powder
  - 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/2 tsp oregano
  - 1/2 lime, juiced
instructions: "Turn your oven’s broiler to high. \n\nMix the spices together in a
  small bowl. Sprinkle them over both sides of the fish and massage gently with your
  fingers to cover thoroughly in the spices. \n\nLay the fish on a baking pan lined
  with aluminum foil. \n\nBroil for 4 to 7 minutes. The fish will cook very quickly,
  so after 4 minutes, check to see if they’re done by gently inserting a butter knife
  into the thickest part. If it goes through easily and the fish flakes apart, you’re
  done. If the knife meets resistance and the fish stays together, put the fillets
  back under the broiler for another few minutes. Once you’ve done this once or twice,
  you’ll be able to tell when your fish is done at a glance. \n\nWhen the fish is
  done, squeeze a lime over it. Serve with rice or a favorite side dish like [spicy
  green beans](spicy-green-beans.yaml#59)."
