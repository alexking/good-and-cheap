  This dish is spicy, crunchy, and almost certainly the pinkest salad you’ll ever eat! Don’t be scared.
ingredients:
  required:
  - 2 to 3 beets, peeled and grated
  - 1 cup chickpeas, cooked or canned
  - 3 tbsp peanuts
  dressing:
  - 1 tbsp lime juice
  - 1 tsp chili sauce
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - salt
  - pepper
instructions: "Peel the raw beets, removing the stems if necessary, then shred the
  beets with a box grater. Place the beets in a bowl along with the chickpeas and
  nuts. \n\nMix up the dressing ingredients in another small bowl and stir to combine.
  Taste and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking. \n\nAdd the dressing to the
  other bowl and mix up all the ingredients. Let it sit for about 5 minutes so that
  the flavors can soak into the vegetables and the beet juices can mingle with the
  dressing."
