  This Indian chickpea dish is a staple in my home. If you don’t have cooked chickpeas around, you can use canned, but it will cost about $1 more.
ingredients:
  required:
  - 1/2 tbsp ghee or 1/2 tbsp butter plus a splash of olive oil
  - 1 tsp cumin seeds
  - 1/2 cup onion, diced
  - 1 tsp garlic, finely chopped 1 tsp ginger root, grated
  - 1/2 jalapeño, finely diced
  - 3 tsp coriander powder
  - 1 tsp turmeric
  - 1/4 tsp cayenne powder
  - 1/2 tsp garam masala powder
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1 cup canned tomatoes, puréed
  - 2 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas, drained
  - 1/2 cup water
  garnish:
  - fresh cilantro
  - yogurt
instructions: |-
  Measure out all the spices except the cumin seeds and put them in a small bowl.

  Let the ghee (clarified butter) melt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. (Ghee is the traditional Indian choice, but you can substitute butter and a splash of olive oil if you can’t find ghee.) Once the ghee begins to sizzle, add the cumin seeds and stir for about 5 seconds. Add the onion and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ginger and jalapeño and cook for 1 more minute. Add the spices and then the puréed tomatoes. Mix, then put a lid on the pan and let everything cook down for 5 to 10 minutes.

  Once the tomato has reduced and the ghee starts to separate from the sauce, add the chickpeas and water. Mix, then bring it to a boil before reducing to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, then squish a few chickpeas with a spoon to thicken the sauce. Garnish with yogurt and cilantro. For a full meal, serve over rice or with roti.
