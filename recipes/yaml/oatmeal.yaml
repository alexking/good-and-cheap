  This basic recipe can be dressed up in so many ways, you’ll never get bored. Oatmeal makes a hot and comforting breakfast; it’ll give you energy for a great morning. It’s also extremely inexpensive, so you can spend a bit more on lunch and dinner.
ingredients:
  required:
  - 1 cup rolled oats
  - 2 cups water
  - 1/4 tsp salt
instructions: |
  In a small pot, add the oats, water and salt. Place it on medium-high heat, just until the water comes to a boil. Immediately turn the heat to low and place a lid on the pot. Cook for 5 minutes, until the oats are soft and tender and most of the water has cooked off. You can add more water if you like your oatmeal smooth and thin, or use slightly less if you want a thick oatmeal.

  This is just the basic recipe; several ideas for how to make it your own follow on the next pages. Whether it’s milky and sweet or savory and salty, I’m sure you can find a favorite way to enjoy a hot bowl of oats in the morning!

      some fresh or frozen berries and the sugar, then stir to combine. There’s nothing
