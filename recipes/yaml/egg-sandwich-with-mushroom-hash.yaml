description: 'Egg sandwiches are a mainstay of every corner deli in NYC, and for good reason: they’re cheap and easy, fast and delicious. I knew I had to include one when Charlene, one of my early supporters, asked for a recipe with eggs and mushrooms. (I’m thankful she did! Because I don’t really like mushrooms, they’re scarce in this book, even though plenty of people love them.) Like most sandwiches, this recipe is really flexible. In particular, you can change the hash to use whatever you have around. Sad leftovers can take on new life when turned into a hash and matched with the rich fattiness of a morning egg.

'
ingredients:
  required:
  - 2 tsp butter
  - 1 small potato, diced
  - 1/2 lb mushrooms, sliced
  - 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
  - 2 eggs
  - salt
  - pepper
  - 2 rolls, 2 English muffins, or 4 slices of bread
  additions:
  - tomato, sliced
  - avocado
  - cheese
  variations:
  - potato and onion
  - potato and pea
  - collards and bacon
  - zucchini
  - chorizo and green chili
instructions: |-
  Melt half the butter in a pan on medium heat, then throw in the potato and cook for 5 minutes, stirring minimally. Season with salt and pepper. Add the mushrooms and garlic, as well as a splash of water if the potatoes are getting stuck to the pan. Cook for another 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are brown and have shrunk down.

  Test the potato by piercing one piece with a fork. If it goes through easily, you’re done. If not, cook for a few more minutes. (The smaller the potatoes are chopped, the quicker they’ll cook.) Taste and adjust the seasoning to your preferences.

  Melt the other teaspoon of butter in another pan on medium heat. Crack the eggs into the pan and dust with salt and pepper again. Salt and pepper are critical to these ingredients, so don’t worry about overdoing it.

  If you like your eggs sunny-side up, place a lid over the pan to ensure the whites will cook through without making the yolks hard. Once the whites are no longer translucent, take them off the heat.

  If you like eggs over-easy (my favorite), wait until the yolks are cooked but still look runny, then flip each egg with a spatula and let the other side cook for about 15 seconds. That’ll get your whites fully cooked, but keep the yolks runny—the best. If you prefer hard yolks (please no!), then cook for a little longer.

  Toast the bread or bun, then assemble it into a sandwich, using any condiments you like. Way better than what you’ll find at the corner deli.
