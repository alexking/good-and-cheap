description: 'Homemade tortillas are a bit of work, but they’re totally worth it.
  With practice, you’ll get quicker and enjoy the process as much as the results.

ingredients:
  required:
  - 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1 1/4 cups whole-wheat flour
  - 2 1/2 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 1/3 cup clarified butter or lard
  - 1 cup hot water
instructions: "In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients. Add clarified butter or
  lard. Lard is more traditional, but I prefer clarified butter. Even regular butter
  is fine. Using your fingers, squish the butter against the flour until the mixture
  looks like moist crumbs. Add the hot water—not boiling, just hot—and form into dough
  with your hands. Leave the dough in the bowl for an hour, covered by plastic wrap
  or a moist towel. \n\nRoll the dough into 24 small balls. Keep them covered with
  the towel. \n\nLightly flour your countertop. Gently flatten one dough ball with
  your palm, then roll it out with a rolling pin. Flip it over to make sure it doesn’t
  stick to the counter; add more flour if it does stick. Once you have the ball rolled
  out nice and thin, set it aside under a moist towel. \n\nOnce you’ve rolled out
  one or two tortillas, put a non-stick or cast-iron pan on medium-high heat. Let
  it get nice and hot. Place a tortilla in the pan. Once it starts to dry up around
  the edges, flip it over with a spatula, then gently press it down to give it some
  color underneath. Once the tortilla has brown spots on both sides, remove it from
  the pan and continue with the next. Work quickly! As you wait for each tortilla
  to cook, roll out more. You’ll get better at this part with practice. \n\nIf you’re
  serving the tortillas soon, place them in a warm oven to keep them pliable. If they’re
  for later in the day, pile them under a cloth while you finish making them. Once
  you’re done, wrap them in aluminum foil and put them in the fridge. Heat in the
  oven before serving."
