  "ingredients": {
    "required": [
      "4 large sweet potatoes",
      "salt",
      "pepper",
      "1/4 cup sour cream",
      "1/2 bunch scallions, finely chopped"
    ]
  },
  "instructions": "Heat the oven to 400 °F. Scrub the sweet potatoes and stab them with a fork a few times. Lay them on a baking sheet. \n\nBake for 60 to 75 minutes. Because sweet potatoes vary greatly in size, check them after an hour by stabbing with a long knife. If it goes through easily, they’re ready. If not, bake longer. \n\nLet cool for 15 minutes. Make a long cut along the top of each potato and open them gently, beating with a fork to fluff up the soft, orange middle. \n\nSprinkle with salt and pepper. Let each person add sour cream and scallions (or more salt and pepper) to their taste."
