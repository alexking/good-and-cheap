  "description": "This salad is a great use for leftover beans (or pulled pork)—crunchy, fresh, yet satisfying enough to be a whole meal. I like to make taco salad in a week where I’ve made a large batch of beans and I’m craving something fresh.\n",
  "ingredients": {
    "required": [
      "4 cups lettuce, chopped",
      "1 cup beans, pulled pork, or ground beef",
      "2 small tomatoes, chopped",
      "1/2 cup corn, canned or fresh",
      "2-3 scallions, finely chopped",
      "1 cup tortilla chips, roughly crushed",
      "sharp cheddar or queso fresco, for sprinkling"
    ],
    "dressing": [
      "1/4 cup sour cream or yogurt",
      "juice of one lime",
      "salt",
      "pepper"
    ],
    "additions": [
      "cucumber",
      "jalapeño",
      "bell peppers",
      "grated carrots",
      "salsa (p. 163)"
    ]
  },
  "instructions": "Mix up the dressing and taste it. Adjust the salt, pepper, and lime to your liking. \n\nMix the other ingredients in a large bowl. Pour the dressing over just before serving and toss to coat the salad evenly. Eat immediately, maybe with a few extra tortilla chips on the side."
