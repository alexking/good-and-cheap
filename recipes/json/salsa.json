    "required": [
      "2 cups tomatoes, chopped",
      "½ medium onion, finely diced",
      "1 jalapeño pepper, finely diced",

      "¼ cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped",
      "salt",

  "instructions": "Apart from its usual use on tortilla chips and tacos, this salsa is a wonderful topping for fish or chicken, as a sauce for cold noodles, or as a finishing touch on a savory breakfast.\n\nIf you like raw onion, go right ahead. Otherwise, take the edge off by sautéing the onion with a bit of water in a pan over medium heat. The onion is ready once the water has boiled off. If you aren’t a fan of cilantro, substitute another herb: mint, savory, or lemon balm work well.\n\nMix the onion, tomato, and the rest of the ingredients in a bowl. Be sure to add enough salt and pepper!\n\nTaste the salsa. You’re looking for a balance of spicy from the peppers, sweet from the tomatoes, and bright and fresh from the herbs and lime juice. If something’s out of balance, add the appropriate ingredient to bring it back into balance.\n\nStore in an air-tight container in the fridge. Fresh salsa won’t last as long as store-bought salsa because it doesn’t have any preservatives, but it’s so tasty that I’m sure you’ll finish it fast!"
