  "description": "If your oven has a broiler, this is a fast and fun way to liven up a standard, healthy breakfast of grapefruit. This method produces a hot and sticky treat.\n",
  "ingredients": {
    "required": [
      "2 grapefruit",
      "2 tbsp brown sugar salt"
    ]
  },
  "instructions": "Turn on the broiler in your oven.\n\nSplit a grapefruit in half and place it on a baking tray or in an oven-proof pan. Sprinkle the pink halves evenly with sugar and top with just a tiny bit of salt to bring out the flavor.\n\nPlace the grapefruit halves under the broiler until they turn bubbly and a little brown (or even black) around the edges. This usually takes about 3 minutes, but monitor it because every broiler is different. Don’t get distracted! Overbroiling ruins a good meal fast.\n\nIf you have maple syrup on hand, use it instead of sugar for even more flavor.\n\nThis breakfast will make a grapefruit lover out of you!"
