    - 1 cup cucumber, chopped
    - ½ cup tomato, chopped

  This recipe is extremely loose. Basically, just stir some of your favorite chopped vegetables into yogurt and add salt and pepper. Use this as a stepping stone to develop your own.

  After you stir all the ingredients together, store the raita in a covered container in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.
