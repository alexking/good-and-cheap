  These are a staple flatbread in many parts of India. They’re quick to make and very tasty when fresh. Enjoy them with a curried filling, dip them in soups or stews, or fill them with eggs at breakfast.

ingredients:
  required:
    - 2 cups whole-wheat flour 
    - 1 tsp salt 
    - 1 cup water

instructions: |
  In a small bowl, mix together all the ingredients using one clean hand. It should form a fairly moist dough. Knead until smooth and form into a ball. Cover with a damp towel or paper towel and set aside for 10 minutes to an hour. 

  Divide the dough into 16 small balls. 

  Sprinkle a countertop with flour and place one piece of dough in the middle. Cover the ball with flour on all sides so that it doesn’t stick to the surface, then gently roll it out with a rolling pin (or a bottle if you’re in a pinch) until it’s thin and flat, about 1/8” thick. As you roll the dough, be sure to unstick it from your counter and flip it over. To make it round, roll straight in front of you, then turn the dough 90 degrees and roll out again. 

  Place a non-stick skillet on medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the roti and cook until the dough lifts away from the pan around the edges and small bubbles form. Flip the bread over and cook the other side. Usually it goes very quickly. You want to see light-brown bubbles all over the dough. Don’t let it get too dark, though, as this will make the roti too crunchy to use for rolls. Repeat this process until you’re finished with the dough. 

  Once you have practiced, you can roll out one roti while another cooks in the pan to make the process quicker. 

  Keep them under a towel on the counter or in a warm oven until ready to serve.
