  This Indian chickpea dish is a staple in my home. If you don’t have cooked chickpeas around, you can use canned, but it will cost about $1 more.

ingredients:
  required:
    - ½ tbsp ghee or ½ tbsp butter plus a splash of olive oil
    - 1 tsp cumin seeds
    - ½ cup onion, diced
    - 1 tsp garlic, finely chopped 1 tsp ginger root, grated
    - ½ jalapeño, finely diced
    - 3 tsp coriander powder 
    - 1 tsp turmeric
    - ¼ tsp cayenne powder
    - ½ tsp garam masala powder
    - 1 tsp smoked paprika
    - ½ tsp salt
    - 1 cup canned tomatoes, puréed 
    - 2½ cups cooked chickpeas, drained
    - ½ cup water

  garnish:
    - fresh cilantro
    - yogurt

instructions: |
  Measure out all the spices except the cumin seeds and put them in a small bowl.

  Let the ghee (clarified butter) melt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. (Ghee is the traditional Indian choice, but you can substitute butter and a splash of olive oil if you can’t find ghee.) Once the ghee begins to sizzle, add the cumin seeds and stir for about 5 seconds. Add the onion and sauté for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the ginger and jalapeño and cook for 1 more minute. Add the spices and then the puréed tomatoes. Mix, then put a lid on the pan and let everything cook down for 5 to 10 minutes.

  Once the tomato has reduced and the ghee starts to separate from the sauce, add the chickpeas and water. Mix, then bring it to a boil before reducing to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, then squish a few chickpeas with a spoon to thicken the sauce. Garnish with yogurt and cilantro. For a full meal, serve over rice or with roti.
