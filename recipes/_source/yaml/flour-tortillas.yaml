  Homemade tortillas are a bit of work, but they’re totally worth it. With practice, you’ll get quicker and enjoy the process as much as the results.

ingredients:
  required:
    - 1¼ cups all-purpose flour 
    - 1¼ cups whole-wheat flour 
    - 2½ tsp baking powder 
    - 1 tsp salt 
    - 1/3 cup clarified butter or lard 
    - 1 cup hot water

instructions: |
  In a large bowl, whisk the dry ingredients. Add clarified butter or lard. Lard is more traditional, but I prefer clarified butter. Even regular butter is fine. Using your fingers, squish the butter against the flour until the mixture looks like moist crumbs. Add the hot water—not boiling, just hot—and form into dough with your hands. Leave the dough in the bowl for an hour, covered by plastic wrap or a moist towel. 

  Roll the dough into 24 small balls. Keep them covered with the towel. 

  Lightly flour your countertop. Gently flatten one dough ball with your palm, then roll it out with a rolling pin. Flip it over to make sure it doesn’t stick to the counter; add more flour if it does stick. Once you have the ball rolled out nice and thin, set it aside under a moist towel. 

  Once you’ve rolled out one or two tortillas, put a non-stick or cast-iron pan on medium-high heat. Let it get nice and hot. Place a tortilla in the pan. Once it starts to dry up around the edges, flip it over with a spatula, then gently press it down to give it some color underneath. Once the tortilla has brown spots on both sides, remove it from the pan and continue with the next. Work quickly! As you wait for each tortilla to cook, roll out more. You’ll get better at this part with practice. 

  If you’re serving the tortillas soon, place them in a warm oven to keep them pliable. If they’re for later in the day, pile them under a cloth while you finish making them. Once you’re done, wrap them in aluminum foil and put them in the fridge. Heat in the oven before serving.
