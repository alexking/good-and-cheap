description: |
  It doesn’t get much simpler or more satisfying than this. You can use any pepper you like—from large, dark poblanos, to Hungarian wax chilies, to bell peppers.

ingredients:
  required:
    - 4 medium potatoes, chopped into bite-sized pieces
    - 4 medium chilies, chopped into bite-sized pieces
    - 2 cloves garlic, unpeeled
    - 1 tbsp butter, melted
    - salt
    - pepper

instructions: |
  In a large roasting pan, tumble together the potatoes, peppers, and garlic. When you chop the peppers, be sure to get rid of the seeds and white placenta inside.

  Pour the butter over top and sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper. Potatoes need quite a bit of salt! Use your hands to mix everything up.

  Roast for 1 hour, or until you can spear the potatoes easily with a fork and everything is a little crispy. Squish the garlic cloves, discard their skins, and spread the roasted garlic throughout.

  In addition to being a great side dish, this makes a delicious taco filling. At left, it’s pictured on a tortilla topped with chopped tomato and queso blanco.

  Alternatively, try it alongside some black beans and rice or piled high on a plate with an egg on top.
