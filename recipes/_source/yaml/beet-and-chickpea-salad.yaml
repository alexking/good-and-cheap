  This dish is spicy, crunchy, and almost certainly the pinkest salad you’ll ever eat! Don’t be scared.

ingredients:
  required:
    - 2 to 3 beets, peeled and grated
    - 1 cup chickpeas, cooked or canned
    - 3 tbsp peanuts

  dressing:
    - 1 tbsp lime juice
    - 1 tsp chili sauce
    - 1 tbsp olive oil
    - salt and pepper

instructions: |
  Peel the raw beets, removing the stems if necessary, then shred the beets with a box grater. Place the beets in a bowl along with the chickpeas and nuts. 

  Mix up the dressing ingredients in another small bowl and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking. 

  Add the dressing to the other bowl and mix up all the ingredients. Let it sit for about 5 minutes so that the flavors can soak into the vegetables and the beet juices can mingle with the dressing.
