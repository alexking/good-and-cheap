description: |
  I like to serve these with all kinds of toppings, usually leftovers from other meals. Try filling them with roast chicken, beans and cheese, corn and tomatoes—whatever you have around.

ingredients:
  required:
    - 4 large sweet potatoes 
    - salt
    - pepper 
    - ¼ cup sour cream 
    - ½ bunch scallions, finely chopped

instructions: |
  Heat the oven to 400 °F. Scrub the sweet potatoes and stab them with a fork a few times. Lay them on a baking sheet. 

  Bake for 60 to 75 minutes. Because sweet potatoes vary greatly in size, check them after an hour by stabbing with a long knife. If it goes through easily, they’re ready. If not, bake longer. 

  Let cool for 15 minutes. Make a long cut along the top of each potato and open them gently, beating with a fork to fluff up the soft, orange middle. 

  Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Let each person add sour cream and scallions (or more salt and pepper) to their taste.
